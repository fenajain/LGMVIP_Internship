Iris Flower Classification ML Project 
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification ML Project repository! 
In this project, we aim to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques. 
This README file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions to get started. 

Project Overview : 
The Iris Flower Classification ML Project is a classic machine learning task that involves training a model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical attributes. 
The dataset used in this project contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica 

Project Structure: 
The project repository is organized as follows: data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. 
The dataset file is named Iris_Dataset. 
The code directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
