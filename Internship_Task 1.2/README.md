# **Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using LSTM**

* Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using LSTM project! *

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive solution for predicting and forecasting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

## Overview:
The stock market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by various factors, making accurate predictions a challenging task. This project leverages LSTM, a powerful deep learning technique known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

By employing LSTM models, we can analyze historical stock market data, extract patterns, and make informed predictions about future market trends. The project offers a robust framework for data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation, enabling users to experiment and refine their forecasting models.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing: Prepare and clean historical stock market data for model training and testing.
- LSTM model architecture: Utilize LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.
- Training and optimization: Train the LSTM model using various optimization algorithms to improve accuracy and convergence.
- Forecasting: Make predictions and generate forecasts for future stock market trends.
- Evaluation: Assess the performance of the LSTM model using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.
- Extensibility: Easily adapt the project to work with different stocks, time periods, or additional features for enhanced prediction capabilities.
