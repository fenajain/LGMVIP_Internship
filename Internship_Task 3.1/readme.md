## **Handwritten Digit Classification Using Neural Network**

This GitHub repository contains a project focused on developing a neural network model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 

The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Methodology
The project follows a well-defined methodology, encompassing several key steps.  

- First, the MNIST dataset is loaded using the Keras library. The dataset consists of labeled images of handwritten digits, which serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the neural network model.

- The data is then preprocessed by reshaping the images and normalizing pixel values, preparing them for training. The one-hot encoding technique is applied to convert the class labels into binary vectors, enabling multi-class classification.

- Next, the neural network model is constructed using the sequential model architecture from Keras. The model consists of multiple dense layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions and dropout regularization, facilitating better generalization.

- The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics. Training is conducted on the preprocessed training data, while monitoring the model's performance on the validation set. The trained model is saved for future use.

- Finally, the model is evaluated on the testing set, providing insights into its classification accuracy. Predictions are made on the test data, and a subset of correctly classified and incorrectly classified samples is visualized using Matplotlib.

By following this methodology, we aim to provide a comprehensive approach to solving the handwritten digit classification problem. The repository includes the source code, dataset, trained model, and visualizations, allowing others to replicate the results and gain valuable insights into deep learning, computer vision, and neural networks.

Overall, this project serves as a stepping stone for individuals interested in understanding and applying neural networks to real-world classification tasks.
